Tools for using org-mode to write LaTeX

This is my setup to write LaTeX files, retaining the rich features of org-mode.
Usage: Write your LaTeX document in org-mode, using LaTeX code blocks for the actual code, e.g.
* Chapter 1
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\chapter{Unum}
Nemo dolorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
#+END_LaTeX
** Section 1 (to finish by <2012-12-31 Mo>)
Comment: If I don't finish by this date, it will be too late anyway...
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\section{More}
#+END_LaTeX
*** Theorem 1
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{theorem}
The world will end on 2012-12-31.
\end{theorem}
#+END_LaTeX
*** TODO [#A] Proof						       :HIDE:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
Not done yet.
#+END_LaTeX
You can hide blocks (including all subblocks) by using TODO-Keyword "NOPE" or the :HIDE: tag.

When you are done writing, use "make". It will make a LaTeX file and compile it using ~pdflatex~.
